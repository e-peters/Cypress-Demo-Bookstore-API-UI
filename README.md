# Cypress-Demo-Bookstore-API-UI
This repository contains the Cypress test scripts which were used by Edwin Peters for demoing REST API testing with Cypress in the meetup group TA Commun_IT on the 25th of November, 2020.
All test scripts in this repository are using the UI on https://demoqa.com/books and the API's on https://demoqa.com

These are a combination of UI and API tests.

There is one other repository containing the test scripts that were used to demo the API only testing:
https://github.com/e-peters/Cypress-Demo-Petstore-API

Use them for your own inspiration.

Have fun!
